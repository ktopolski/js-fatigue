# Javascripting

The content of the course turned out to be the very basics of javascript programming. Variables, arrays, functions, loops all the stuff.

**Do not take this course if you already have like ANY javascript programming experience**

Also, do not take this course if you are hungry, there are a lot of food references!

# What I've learned

While I practiced invoking functions right after defining them, I didn't know there's IIFE acronym for it.
