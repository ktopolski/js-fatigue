# Test Anything

Awesome course. Takes you from `console.log` to the world of `tape` module painlessly. I heard about the `tape` and even read couple articles that advices using `tape` instead of all-out test frameworks like `jasmine`, so I was happy to try out `tape`.

Course not only teaches basic JS testing skills, but also promotes the _Test Driven Development_ which is really cool. I was dissapointed about error messages being outputed by the course's `verify` method. They were not helpful and definitely not **TAP** compatible. However, it made me write not only the tests, but also functions fullfiling them, which brings out cool _TDD_ to the world of JS.

If you are familiar with `RSpec` then `tape` will look quite familiar :).

# What I've learned

1. "Test anything" is not only a course name, but also a name of the protocol specifying format of test output messages - **TAP**. Guess why `tape` is called `tape`.
2. Basics of node assertions.
3. Basic tests with `tape`. I like how course promotes the _Test Driven Development_.
