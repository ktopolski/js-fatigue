# js-fatigue
JavaScript fatigue is recently a very common name describing situation in present JavaScript ecosystem. New frameworks come and go in weeks(if not days), people are confused what to learn and what to use, jQuery-alone project is dommed and you just have to use webpack, babel, es6, *\<framework of your choice here\>* and *\<100 plugins to your framework of choice\>*. People become more and more tired with JavaScript, but there isn't anything better so they have to stick with it.

## so why are you creating this repo?

Because I'm not fed up with JS yet. Like probably ~90% of you I learned JS together with jQuery and then *evolved* to things like AngularJS and so on. I've been working with Angular, React, Backbone, Marionette and many other tools since then, but never actually been forced to take any of my personal projects from jQuery to any of those frameworks. So, **I don't quite understand the JS fatigue**. I can't see why I should use webpack, frameworks and so on from the start and why spending few hours configuring the whole webpack stack and thousands of dependencies only to get started is going to help me develop better software.

### Here's this cool seed project you should check out...

No, just no.

### What's the plan then?

I've recently read that you should start with plain old javascript to grow up and admire new tools. You should actually encounter situation when any of the cool frameworks may be the solution. I'm going to do exactly that by starting with doing some oldie but goldie <a href="https://nodeschool.io">nodeschool.io</a> courses for pure JavaScript, then build a vanilla js project and we can go from there. I want to actually see when all this new cool shiny things stack is going to save my ass from pure js spaghetti.
