# Scope, Chains & Closures

This turned out to be the right course to go right after _javascripting_, because last lesson of *javascripting* was... "Scope". The course itself is quite interesting on names and not so interesting in content. Content becomes interesting when you start learning on Garbage Collector.

**I advise taking this course even if you're pro in javascript, GC is worth it. Don't just go straight to GC lesson, because relations between GC, scope, scope chains and closures are what's important there!**

# What I've learned

1. **How to detect Garbage Collecting using chrome dev tools, what GC algorithm most JS engines use, what is a relation between scope, scope chains, closures and Garbage Collector. This point alone is why this course IS worth it.**
2. New wording - lexical scoping, scope chain, shadowing, closuring
3. ES6 introduced **block scope** with **let** - this is funny because I aimed for understanding what's really going in previous ES versions, yet I encountered ES6 in just second course of the day.
