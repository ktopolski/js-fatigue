# Regex Adventure

I strongly believe that if you would like to say "I know basics of this programming language" you have to know how to parse strings with regexps using this language. This course is teaching exactly it. **If you don't feel strong at regexps I strongly encourage you to take this course**. If you are familiar with regexps, but you would like to test your knowledge, this is also a right course to take.

# What I've learned

1. Somehow, I didn't know about _\b_ matcher. My greps will get a lot easier now!
2. Usage of _negated character classes_ to find quoted text - this one was really clever!
3. Trick with using _String.prototype.replace_ with capture group definitely will be handy too.
4. Difference between various methods used to deal with regexps in JS.
